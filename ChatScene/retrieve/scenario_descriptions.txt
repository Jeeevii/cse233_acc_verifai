The ego vehicle is merging onto a highway from an on-ramp while an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) vehicle follows behind, maintaining a safe following distance. The ego vehicle suddenly changes lanes at varying speeds, testing the ACC vehicle's ability to adapt to unpredictable merging behavior. The ACC vehicle must adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance to avoid a potential collision.
The ego vehicle begins a series of sudden merges on the highway, moving unpredictably in and out of lanes, forcing an ACC vehicle to react by adjusting its speed and maintaining a safe distance. The goal is to evaluate the ACC system's ability to handle sudden lane changes and maintain safe following distances on a busy highway.
The ego vehicle merges onto a busy highway with multiple ACC-controlled vehicles behind it. The ego vehicle merges at various speeds and distances from the ACC vehicles, testing the ACC's ability to react to close merges and unpredictable lane changes while maintaining safe distances.
The ego vehicle drives aggressively on a highway, making frequent, sudden merges with varying speeds. An ACC vehicle follows behind, reacting to the ego vehicle's unpredictable behavior by braking and accelerating to maintain a safe following distance. The scenario tests the ACC vehicle’s responsiveness to erratic lane behavior.
The ego vehicle is on a highway on-ramp and merges onto the highway with a significant number of ACC vehicles behind. The ego vehicle frequently changes lanes at random speeds, forcing the ACC vehicles to adapt quickly to prevent rear-end collisions or other dangerous situations.
The ego vehicle approaches a highway with multiple lanes and begins merging in and out of lanes in quick succession. An ACC vehicle follows behind, adjusting its speed to maintain a safe distance. The scenario evaluates how well the ACC system adapts to fast-moving, erratic lane changes by the ego vehicle.
The ego vehicle is driving on a highway, attempting to merge into a lane where multiple ACC vehicles are present. The ego vehicle accelerates and decelerates unpredictably while merging, forcing the ACC vehicle to make rapid speed adjustments and maintain a safe following distance.
The ego vehicle starts from a highway on-ramp and merges with traffic, making sudden lane changes at varying speeds. An ACC vehicle follows closely behind, trying to adjust to the merging situation by braking and accelerating to maintain a safe distance. The scenario tests ACC vehicle performance during unexpected lane changes.
The ego vehicle suddenly changes lanes on a highway in front of an ACC vehicle, creating a tight gap that forces the ACC vehicle to react by braking or accelerating to avoid a collision. The scenario evaluates the effectiveness of ACC in responding to sudden, aggressive maneuvers by the lead vehicle.
The ego vehicle merges abruptly onto a highway, cutting off an ACC vehicle that has to brake suddenly to maintain a safe distance. The scenario tests how ACC systems handle unexpected lane changes and potential close calls.
The ego vehicle is driving on a highway and performs a high-speed merge into a lane where an ACC vehicle is following. The ACC vehicle must react quickly to avoid tailgating and maintain a safe following distance by adjusting its speed.
The ego vehicle performs an erratic lane change in front of an ACC vehicle, causing the ACC vehicle to brake suddenly. The scenario tests the ACC system’s ability to adapt to sudden, unpredictable maneuvers by the lead vehicle.
The ego vehicle is merging onto a busy highway, frequently changing lanes in front of an ACC vehicle. The ACC vehicle must adjust its speed continuously to maintain a safe following distance while also keeping an eye on other surrounding traffic.
The ego vehicle merges onto a highway in front of an ACC vehicle but frequently adjusts its speed and lane position, making it difficult for the ACC vehicle to maintain a safe following distance. The scenario tests ACC's ability to handle such erratic driving.
The ego vehicle merges onto a highway from an on-ramp and rapidly changes lanes in front of an ACC vehicle, forcing the ACC vehicle to brake and accelerate to avoid a collision. The scenario tests the ACC system’s ability to react to sudden lane changes and rapid speed adjustments.
The ego vehicle, while merging, crosses into the ACC vehicle's lane unexpectedly. The ACC vehicle must adapt by either braking or changing lanes to avoid a collision. This scenario tests the ACC system's ability to react to sudden lane blockages by other vehicles.
