'''The ego vehicle drives aggressively on a highway, making frequent, sudden merges with varying speeds. An ACC vehicle follows behind, reacting to the ego vehicle's unpredictable behavior by braking and accelerating to maintain a safe following distance. The scenario tests the ACC vehicleâ€™s responsiveness to erratic lane behavior.'''
